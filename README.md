# Interview Scheduler 

Interview Scheduler is single page application that allows users to easily manage their bookings with interviewers. It has been built using React with the help of storybook, which has allowed the incremental component-wise development of the App. Webpack-dev-server was used during development and tests were implemented using Jest, testing library, and cypress.
